# Vanderbilt Value Set Project

Hey there! This is a Django-based web app that helps users find, view, compare, and select value sets for different medical use cases. I tried to keep it simple and user-friendly, with some cool features like:


## Features

- **Search and Filter**: Easily search and filter value sets by name or medication.
- **Pagination**: Browse through value sets with easy pagination.
- **Detailed Views**: Get detailed information about each value set and its medications.
- **Comparison**: Compare multiple value sets and see common medications.
- **Interactive Charts**: Visualize data with beautiful bar charts powered by Chart.js.

## Getting Started
